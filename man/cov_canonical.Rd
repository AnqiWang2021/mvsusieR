\title{Compute a list of canonical covariance matrices}
\usage{
cov_canonical(R, singletons = T, hetgrid = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{an integer indicating the number of conditions}

\item{singletons}{a logical value indicating whether the singleton matrices are computed}

\item{hetgrid}{a vector of numbers between -1 and 1, each representing the off-diagonal elements of matrices with 1s on the diagonal. 
If 0 is included, the identity matrix will be returned which corresponds to assuming effects are independent across conditions. 
IF NULL, these matrices are not computed.}
