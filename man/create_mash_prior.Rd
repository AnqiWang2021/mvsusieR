\usage{
create_mash_prior(fitted_g = NULL, mixture_prior = NULL,
  sample_data = NULL, null_weight = NULL, alpha = 0,
  weights_tol = 1e-10, max_mixture_len = 40, include_indices = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitted_g}{from mashr::mash}

\item{mixture_prior}{a list of (weights = vector(), matrices = list()) where  matrices is a list of prior matrices and have same length as weights.}

\item{sample_data}{a list of (X=X,Y=Y,residual_variance=residual_variance,center=T,scale=T) to allow for automatically determine canonical priors with equal weights}

\item{null_weight}{whether or not to add a weight for null in single effect models. By default it takes the null weight from fitted_g
if available. Use `null_weight = 0` to override the behavior.}

\item{alpha}{0 for EE, 1 for EZ model. See mashr::mash() for details.}

\item{weights_tol}{filter out priors with weights smaller than weights_tol}

\item{max_mixture_len}{only keep the top priors by weight so that the list of mixture prior is of max_mixture_len.
Use `max_mixture_len=-1` to include all input weights after weights_tol filtering. Default is set to length 40.}

\item{include_indices}{postprocess input prior to only include conditions from this indices}
