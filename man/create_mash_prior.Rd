\usage{
create_mash_prior(
  fitted_g = NULL,
  mixture_prior = NULL,
  sample_data = NULL,
  null_weight = NULL,
  use_grid = FALSE,
  weights_tol = 1e-10,
  max_mixture_len = -1,
  include_indices = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitted_g}{from mashr::mash}

\item{mixture_prior}{a list of (weights = vector(), matrices =
list()) where matrices is a list of prior matrices and have same
length as weights.}

\item{sample_data}{a list of
(X=X,Y=Y,residual_variance=residual_variance,center=T,scale=T) to
allow for automatically determine canonical priors with equal
weights}

\item{null_weight}{whether or not to add a weight for null in
single effect models. By default it takes the null weight from
fitted_g if available. Use \code{null_weight = 0} to override this.}

\item{use_grid}{Expand mixture by grid values as in MASH (not
necessary when prior scalar is estimated).}

\item{weights_tol}{Filter out mixture components with weights
smaller than \code{weights_tol}.}

\item{max_mixture_len}{Only keep the top priors by weight so that
the list of mixture prior is of length \code{max_mixture_len}. Use
\code{max_mixture_len = -1} to include all input weights after
filtering by \code{weights_tol}.}

\item{include_indices}{Post-process input prior to only include
conditions from this indices.}

\item{\dots}{other parameters, for mvsusieR:::create_cov_canonical}
