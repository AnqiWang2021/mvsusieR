\usage{
create_mixture_prior(
  mixture_prior,
  R,
  null_weight = NULL,
  weights_tol = 1e-10,
  max_mixture_len = -1,
  include_indices = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mixture_prior}{a list of (weights = vector(), matrices =
list()) where matrices is a list of prior matrices and have same
length as weights.}

\item{R}{number of traits}

\item{null_weight}{whether or not to add a weight for null in
single effect models. By default it takes the null weight from
fitted_g if available. Use \code{null_weight = 0} to override this.}

\item{weights_tol}{Filter out mixture components with weights
smaller than \code{weights_tol}.}

\item{max_mixture_len}{Only keep the top priors by weight so that
the list of mixture prior is of length \code{max_mixture_len}. Use
\code{max_mixture_len = -1} to include all input weights after
filtering by \code{weights_tol}.}

\item{include_indices}{Post-process input prior to only include
conditions from this indices.}

\item{\dots}{other parameters, for mvsusieR:::create_cov_canonical}
