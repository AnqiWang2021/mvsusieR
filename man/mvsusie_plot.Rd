}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{The mvSuSiE fitted model.}

\item{chr}{The chromosome number.}

\item{pos}{The positions of the genetic markers. It should have the
same length as \code{fit$variable_names}.}

\item{markers}{The names of the genetic markers (usually SNPs).}

\item{conditions}{The names of the conditions.}

\item{poslim}{The range of positions to show in the PIP plot.}

\item{lfsr_cutoff}{The significance level for lfsr. The default is
0.01.}

\item{sentinel_only}{If \code{TRUE}, only plot the sentinel marker
for each CS. If \code{FALSE}, plot all markers in each CS.}

\item{cs_plot}{The CSs included in the plot. The default is to show
all CSs.}

\item{add_cs}{If \code{TRUE}, add colored dots to the top of the
effect plot showing CS membership.}

\item{conditional_effect}{If \code{TRUE}, plot the conditional
effect. If \code{FALSE}, plot the marginal effect.
\code{conditional_effect = TRUE} is recommended.}

\item{cs_colors}{The color palette for CSs.}
}
\value{
The output includes the PIP plot, effect plot, z-scores
  plot (if z-scores are available in \code{fit}), and the table of
  effect estimates at sentinel markers.
}
\description{
Create the PIP plot and accompanying effect plot
  showing the effect estimates and significance of the effects for
  all the traits. A z-scores plot is also created when z-scores are
  available.
